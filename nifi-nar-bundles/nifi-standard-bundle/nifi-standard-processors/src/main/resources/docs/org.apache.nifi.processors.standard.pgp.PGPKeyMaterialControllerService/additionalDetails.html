    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Controller Service that maintains PGP Key Materials.
    </p>

    <p>
        The controller service supports the following operations via the four related PGP processors:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>FlowFile content encryption via <code>EncryptPGP</code></li>
        <li>Content decryption via <code>DecryptPGP</code></li>
        <li>Digital signing of content via <code>SignPGP</code></li>
        <li>Digital signature verification via <code>VerifyPGP</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Each of these operations requires a specific Controller Service configuration: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Encrypt requires either Public Key Text, Public Key File, or a PBE pass-phrase</li>
        <li>Decrypt requires either Secret Key Text, Secret Key File, or a PBE pass-phrase</li>
        <li>Sign requires Secret Key Text or Secret Key File</li>
        <li>Verify requires Public Key Text or Public Key File</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Public and Secret Keys may be specified directly via the text fields, or as filenames via the file fields.
        In each of these cases, the specific key the controller uses may be specified by the <code>User ID</code> fields.
        If no user id is specified, the controller uses the first available key.
    </p>
